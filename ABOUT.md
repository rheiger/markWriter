# About MarkWrite

MarkWrite is a minimal, cross‑platform Markdown editor for desktop.
It pairs a native Qt (PySide6) shell with a modern WYSIWYG Markdown editor (Toast UI Editor) running in Qt WebEngine.

## Highlights
- Clean, distraction‑reduced UI
- WYSIWYG Markdown editing with keyboard shortcuts
- Open/Save `.md`, export to `.html`
- Zoom controls and a responsive layout
- PyInstaller packaging for easy distribution
- MacOS (15+) and MS Windows ready

## Technology
- Python 3.11+
- PySide6 (Qt 6) + Qt WebEngine
- Toast UI Editor (via CDN for now)
- PyInstaller for macOS/Windows/Linux bundles

## Credits
- Base implementation performed in Cursor with AI support
- Idea and management by Richie Eiger

## Roadmap (short)
- Linux builds (CI included)
- App settings (fonts, sizes, theme)
- Standard desktop menus (Edit, View, Window, …)
- Multi‑window/tabs
